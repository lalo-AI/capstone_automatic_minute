# capstone_automatic_minute
This concerns an automatic minute creation tool that, through voice recognition and audio recording, 
generates an easily understandable Excel format. The goal is to save time in creating and sending documents 
to facilitate the tracking of a deliverable or project.

The objective is to streamline the process, enhancing user experience by providing a quick and efficient solution. 
This tool aims to revolutionize the way minutes are created, making it more accessible and user-friendly. 
Users can simply speak their thoughts, and the tool converts the spoken words into a well-organized Excel document. 
This not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and consistency in documenting project details.

Overall, this innovative solution aims to enhance productivity, reduce administrative burdens, and improve 
the overall experience of managing and documenting project-related information.

Considerations:
I had to develop code in Python using Streamlit to test and deploy, because I needed to access some hardware from a 
local computer, in that case a microphone to enter the commands and record the voice and use the ChatGPT API to do 
the transcription and finally generate the minutes in an Excel template.

Note:
I couldn't use Google Colab/Jupiter Notebook because the environment doesn't allow using local computer hardware.
